    "text": "What I Learned in DAT303 at DMACC\nIn this post, I talk about the main things I learned throughout the DAT303 course at Des Moines Area Community College (DMACC). Being a DMACC student has given me the chance to work with real tools used in the data industry, and this class was a big part of that experience.\nDAT303 introduced important concepts used in analytics, including how data is collected, cleaned, analyzed, and visualized. It also helped me understand how to communicate findings clearly through documentation.\nSome of the main topics we covered in this course include:\n\ndata analysis workflows\n\nMarkdown and Quarto documentation\n\ncreating reproducible reports\n\npublishing projects using GitHub Pages\n\nbasic data visualization principles\n\ncommunicating results with charts and summaries\n\nThis class helped me become more comfortable with technical tools and improved my ability to work through data problems step-by-step. DMACC’s hands-on approach made the learning process easier, and working on projects like this blog has helped me build strong academic skills for my CIS/Data career.\nThis post is part of my DAT303 final project blog created at DMACC."
