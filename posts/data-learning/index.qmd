# What I Learned in DAT303 at DMACC

In this post, I talk about the main things I learned throughout the DAT303 course
at **Des Moines Area Community College (DMACC)**. Being a DMACC student has given me
the chance to work with real tools used in the data industry, and this class was
a big part of that experience.

DAT303 introduced important concepts used in analytics, including how data is
collected, cleaned, analyzed, and visualized. It also helped me understand how
to communicate findings clearly through documentation.

Some of the main topics we covered in this course include:

- data analysis workflows  
- Markdown and Quarto documentation  
- creating reproducible reports  
- publishing projects using GitHub Pages  
- basic data visualization principles  
- communicating results with charts and summaries  

This class helped me become more comfortable with technical tools and improved
my ability to work through data problems step-by-step. DMACC’s hands-on approach
made the learning process easier, and working on projects like this blog has
helped me build strong academic skills for my CIS/Data career.

This post is part of my DAT303 final project blog created at DMACC.
