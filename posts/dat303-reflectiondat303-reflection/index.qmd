# DAT303 Final Project Reflection

This post is a reflection about my experience in DAT303 and building this blog.

I learned how to:
- use Quarto to create `.qmd` files  
- render documents to HTML  
- publish a blog on GitHub Pages  
- organize posts inside the `posts` folder  

Creating this blog helped me practice reproducible reporting, basic Markdown,
and working with GitHub repositories. It also showed me how data projects can
be documented and shared online.
