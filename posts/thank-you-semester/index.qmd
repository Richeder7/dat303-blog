# Thank You for This Semester

As this semester comes to an end, I want to take a moment to express my
appreciation for everything I learned in DAT303 at **DMACC (Des Moines Area Community College)**.

This course helped me grow academically and technically. I learned how to:

- organize projects using Quarto  
- publish and manage files through GitHub Pages  
- write clear and reproducible reports  
- work more confidently with data and documentation  
- understand the importance of communication in data analytics  

I am grateful for the support, structure, and guidance that DMACC provides.
Being a student here has helped me stay focused, improve my skills, and continue
moving toward my goals in the Computer Information Systems program.

Thank you for this semester.  
I look forward to continuing to grow as a DMACC student.
